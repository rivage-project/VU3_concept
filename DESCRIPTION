Description: This project aims at designing and testing a method to calculate the vulnerability 
    of islands to multiple threats, for plants, birds and mammals. The objective is to include three
    components of vulnerability, namely the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of insular 
    biota facing the threats. Here, we will test the vulnerability framework on a subset of well-described 
    islands in terms of biodiversity data.
